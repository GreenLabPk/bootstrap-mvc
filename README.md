# bootstrap-mvc
BootstrapMvc provides an HTML helper to generate bootstrap related elements easily.

#### Bootstrap MVC in a nutshell:

ASP.NET MVC (>3) projects provide easy way to generate HTML code through the HTML helper, but comes with a set of predefined classes that won't match any other framework.

Using extension methods and additional classes, Bootstrap MVC takes care of this issue by generating adapted HTML for the Bootstrap Framework.

This project will be first released as a library, then as a NuGet package.
The main target here is Twitter's Bootstrap but this project might be extended to other frameworks later depending on demands.

#### Updates:

##### 2015/01/15
Moved the project from Codeplex to Github
Dusted a bit around, and updated to latest Bootstrap version (used in ASP.NET Web Apps)
